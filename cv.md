## Summary:
- Hi! I'm guitar teacher. I like to compose, record, and mixing music. Currently I'm learning front-end development. Long time ago I had some experience with PHP and entry level Web-Development.
My love for programming has been growing since childhood. When I was a little boy my first experiments were in Delphi when I was trying to write my own download manager. Later I learned to write websites on my own. I tried to make multi-page HTML sites, where I described the heroes of my favorite films and games. When I first got acquainted with PHP, I was interested in writing different scripts that performed actions for me in social networks. For example: changing the profile information every 30 minutes, changing the avatar with the current weather, exchange rates and random jokes from bash.org. I've been a guitar teacher for a long time, but I keep returning to web development as a hobby. Maybe it's time to make it more than a hobby, and may RS School help me with that!
